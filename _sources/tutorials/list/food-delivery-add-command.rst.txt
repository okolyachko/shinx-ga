Step 4: Add a voice command
===========================

When we created the project in Alan Studio, Alan automatically added a voice script with a simple voice command to it. We will use it as an
example to add a new command, or `intent <../../server-api/commands-and-responses#intent>`__, to our
voice script.

To the voice script, add the following command and save the script:

.. code:: javascript

    intent('I want a pepperoni', p => {
        p.play('Adding pepperoni for you');
    });

.. note::

    ``p`` in the command references an internal object that we can use to call Alan's native methods and access its predefined objects. Here, it is used to call the `play() method <../../server-api/commands-and-responses#play>`__.

Check how the new command works in the Debugging Chat in the right pane of Alan Studio or directly in the web page. Click the Alan button and say: ``I want a pepperoni``. Alan will reply: ``Adding pepperoni for you``.
