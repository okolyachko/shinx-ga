Step 5: Specify alternatives and options
========================================

The phrase used to invoke a voice command is called a `pattern <../../server-api/patterns.html>`__. At present, our command is invoked
by one phrase: ``I want a pepperoni``. However, the users can give a voice command in different ways. For example:

-  ``I will take a pepperoni``
-  ``Add a pepperoni``
-  ``Add a pepperoni, please``
-  Or just ``Pepperoni``

To be sure the voice command is invoked by any of these phrases, we can add `alternatives  <../../server-api/patterns.html#patterns-with-alternatives>`__ and `options <../../server-api/patterns.html#optional-alternatives>`__ to the command pattern.

-  To define alternatives, enclose all possible variants in brackets and use the ``|`` delimiter.
-  To define optional parts of the user command, enclose these parts in brackets and add ``|`` at the end of them.

.. code-block:: javascript
  :emphasize-lines: 1

    intent('(I want|I will take|Add|) (a|) pepperoni, (please|)', p => {
        p.play('Adding pepperoni for you');
    });

Now all the above phrases will work.

You can also specify a list of phrases with which your voice assistant will reply: add all variants to the ``p.play`` function and separate them with a comma. When this command is invoked, Alan will pick one phrase at random and play it to the user.

.. code-block:: javascript
  :emphasize-lines: 2

    intent('(I want|I will take|Add|) (a|) pepperoni, (please|)', p => {
        p.play('Adding pepperoni for you', 'Sure', 'Here you go');
    });
