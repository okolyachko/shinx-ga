Step 2: Create a voice assistant
================================

To add a voice assistant to the app, we need to create a project in Alan Studio. In the project, we will write a dialog, or the voice script, with commands for our app.

1. Sign up for Alan Studio or sign in if you are already registered.

   .. tip::
   When you sign up, Alan adds free interactions to your balance to let you get started. To get additional interactions to your  balance, sign up with your GitHub account or connect your Alan account with your GitHub account and give stars to Alan repositories.

2. In Alan Studio, click **Create Voice Assistant**, choose to create an empty project, specify the project name and click **Create**.
