Building a voice assistant for a React Native app
=================================================

With Alan's :doc:`voice assistant SDK for React Native <../../client-api/cross-platform/react-native>`, you can create a voice assistant or chatbot and embed it to your React Native app. The Alan Platform provides you with all the tools and leverages the industryâ€™s best Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Speech Synthesis technologies to quickly build an in-app voice assistant from scratch.

In this tutorial, we will create a simple React Native app with Alan voice and test drive it on the simulator. The app users will be able to tap the voice assistant button and give custom voice commands, and Alan will reply to them.

What you will learn
-------------------

-  How to add a voice interface to a React Native app
-  How to write simple voice commands for a React Native app


What you will need
------------------

To go through this tutorial, make sure the following prerequisites are met:

-  You have signed up to Alan Studio.
-  You have :doc:`created a project <../../usage/guides/projects>` in Alan Studio.
-  You have set up the React Native environment and it is functioning properly. For details, see `React Native documentation <https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup>`__.
-  You have installed CocoaPods to manage dependencies for an Xcode project:

   .. code:: bash

       sudo gem install cocoapods

.. note:: 

   When you sign up to Alan Studio, Alan adds free interactions to your balance to let you get started. To get additional interactions to your balance, link your Alan account with your GitHub account and give stars to `Alan repositories <https://github.com/alan-ai>`__. For details, see :ref:`Adding free interactions <Adding free interactions>`.


Step 1: Create a React Native app
---------------------------------

For this tutorial, we will be using a simple React Native app. Let's create it.

1. On your machine, navigate to the folder in which the app will reside and run the following command:

   .. code:: bash

       npx react-native init myApp

2. Run the app:

   .. code:: bash

       cd myApp
       npx react-native run-ios

.. image:: /_static/assets/img/react-native-tutorial/create-app.png

Step 2: Integrate the app with Alan
-----------------------------------

Now we will add the Alan button to our app. First, we will install the Alan React Native plugin:

1. In the app folder, run the following command:

   ::

       npm i @alan-ai/alan-sdk-react-native --save

2. Open the ``App.js`` file. At the top of the file, add the import statement:

   .. code:: typescript

       import { AlanView } from '@alan-ai/alan-sdk-react-native';

3. To the function component, add the Alan button:

   .. code-block :: coffeescript

       const App: () => Node = () => {
         ...
         return (
           <SafeAreaView style={backgroundStyle}>
             <StatusBar barStyle={isDarkMode ? 'light-content' : 'dark-content'} />
             <ScrollView
               contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"
               style={backgroundStyle}>
               <Header />
               <View
                 style={{
                   backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? Colors.black : Colors.white,
                 }}>
                 ...
               </View>
             </ScrollView>
             // Adding the Alan button
             <View><AlanView projectid={''}/></View>
           </SafeAreaView>
         );
       };

4. In ``projectid``, specify the Alan SDK key for your Alan Studio project. To get the key, in Alan Studio, at the top of the code editor, click **Integrations** and copy the value from the **Alan SDK
   Key** field.

   .. code-block :: coffeescript

       const App: () => Node = () => {
         ...
         return (
           <SafeAreaView style={backgroundStyle}>
             <StatusBar barStyle={isDarkMode ? 'light-content' : 'dark-content'} />
             <ScrollView
               contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"
               style={backgroundStyle}>
               <Header />
               <View
                 style={{
                   backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? Colors.black : Colors.white,
                 }}>
                 ...
               </View>
             </ScrollView>
             // Providing the Alan SDK key
             <View><AlanView projectid={'f19e47b478189e4e7d43485dbc3cb44a2e956eca572e1d8b807a3e2338fdd0dc/stage'}/></View>
           </SafeAreaView>
         );
       };

5. In the Terminal, navigate to the ``ios`` folder, open the Podfile and change the minimum iOS version to 11:

   .. code:: bash

       platform :ios, '11.0'

6. Run the following command to install dependencies for the project:

   .. code:: bash

       pod install

7. In iOS, the user must explicitly grant permission for an app to access the microphone and camera. Alan will use the microphone for voice interactions and camera for :ref:`testing Alan projects on
   mobile<Testing on mobile>`. We need to add special keys with the description for the user why the app requires access to these resources.

   a. In the ``ios`` folder, open the generated XCode workspace file: ``myApp.xcworkspace``.

   b. In Xcode, go to the **Info** tab.

   c. In the **Custom iOS Target Properties** section, hover over any key in the list and click the plus icon to the right.

   d. From the list, select **Privacy - Microphone Usage Description**.

   e. In the **Value** field to the right, provide a description for the added key. This description will be displayed to the user when the app is launched.

   f. Repeat the steps above to add the **Privacy - Camera Usage Description** key.
   
   .. image:: /_static/assets/img/react-native-tutorial/permission.png

8. Run the app:

   .. code:: bash

       npx react-native run-ios

The app will be built and launched. When accessing the device microphone, Alan will display a message we have specified for the **Privacy - Microphone Usage Description** key.

.. image:: /_static/assets/img/react-native-tutorial/alan-button.png

In the bottom left corner, tap the Alan button and say: ``Hello world``.

However, if you try to ask: ``How are you doing``? Alan will not give an appropriate response. This is because the voice script in Alan Studio does not contain the necessary voice commands so far.


Step 3: Add voice commands
--------------------------

Let's add some :doc:`voice commands <../../server-api/commands-and-responses>` so that we can interact with Alan. In Alan Studio, open the project and in the code editor, add the following intents:

.. code:: javascript

    intent ('What is your name?', p => {
        p.play('It is Alan, and yours?');
    });

    intent ('How are you doing?', p => {
        p.play('Good, thank you. What about you?');
    });

Now tap the Alan button in the app and ask: ``What is your name?`` and ``How are you doing?`` Alan will give responses we have provided in the added intents.

.. note::

   After integration, you may get a warning related to the ``onButton`` state. You can safely ignore it: the warning will be removed as soon as you add the ``onCommand`` handler to your app. For details, see the next tutorial: :doc:`Sending commands to the app <sending-commands-react-native>`.


What's next?
------------

You can now proceed to building a voice interface with Alan. Here are some helpful resources:

-  Have a look at the next tutorial: :doc:`Sending commands to the app <sending-commands-react-native>`.
-  Go to :doc:`Script concepts <../../server-api/script-concepts>` to learn about Alan concepts and functionality you can use to create a voice script.
-  In Alan Git, get the `React Native example app <https://github.com/alan-ai/alan-sdk-reactnative/tree/master/examples/testapp>`__. Use this app to see how integration for React Native apps can be implemented.
