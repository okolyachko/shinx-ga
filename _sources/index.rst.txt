2. Create a voice script
-------------------------- 

In Alan Studio, write a voice script. Voice scripts describe the structure of the dialog with the user, or the expected conversation scenario.

.. panels::

	---
   :card: border-0
   :opticon:`code,size=24` **Example scripts**
   
   
   In Alan Studio, select predefined voice assistants to see how voice scripts can be organized. Start with 'Hello World'.

   ---
   :card: border-0
   :opticon:`gear,size=24` **Server API**

   Learn what Alan functionality you can use to create a script for your voice assistant in Alan Studio.
