Voice analytics
===============

As your customers interact with a voice assistant in your app, Alan AI captures voice data and analyzes key conversational metrics. You can access this information and use it to:

•	Understand the users’ behavior and flows
•	Identify unrecognized utterances and unhandled requests and find shortcuts to let users get faster with the voice
•	Optimize the voice assistant effectiveness and create more personalized voice experiences

To mine and analyze conversational data, use the following tools in Alan Studio:

-	:doc:`Projects dashboard <dashboard>`
-	:doc:`Analytics View <analytics-view>`
-	:doc:`Alan Studio logs <logs>`

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :hidden:
   
   Projects dashboard<dashboard>
   Analytics View<analytics-view>

.. raw:: html

   <div id="blue-background"></div>
   <div id="wide-content"></div>
