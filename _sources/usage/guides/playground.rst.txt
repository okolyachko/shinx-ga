Alan Playground
===============

Alan offers the Alan Playground â€” a mobile application that allows you to quickly preview and evaluate how voice assistants built with Alan work, as well as test your voice assistants for web, iOS or Android.

The Alan Playground can run on iOS- and Android-based mobile devices. Download the Alan Playground application for `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alan-playground/id1474478921?l=en>`__ or `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.alan.playground&hl=en_US>`__ and install it on your device. You can then use it to get familiar with Alan app examples or :ref:`test your voice
scripts <Playground testing>`.

In Alan Playground, you can experiment with Alan's example scripts, such as the CRM or Weather application. Each of these applications provides basic services and utilizes the script functionality described in the :doc:`Script concepts <../../server-api/script-concepts>` section of documentation.

To evaluate example scripts in Alan Playground:

1. On your mobile device, launch Alan Playground.
2. In the **Projects** section, tap the script you want to evaluate.
3. For each script, Alan provides short instructions on how to get started with voice. Follow them to start your customer journey with a voice interface.
