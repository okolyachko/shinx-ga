Billing and subscriptions
=========================

When you sign up for Alan Studio, Alan creates a billing account for you. From the billing account, you can pay for the services provided by Alan.

All information about subscriptions, payments and billing is available in the **Billing** and **Subscription** views of Alan Studio. To access them, in the top right corner of Alan Studio, click the main menu icon and select **Billing** or **Subscription**.

When working with billing data and subscriptions, you can: 

- `Change the pricing plan <#changing-the-pricing-plan>`__ 
- `Add funds to the Alan Studio balance <#adding-funds-to-the-balance>`__ 
- `Add free interactions to the balance <#adding-free-interactions>`__


.. note:: 

   In Alan, you can be charged per interaction or per user, depending on your pricing plan. 
   
   - An interaction is a user's utterance associated with Alan's reply. 
   - A user is counted as a device from which the user connects to Alan. The user initiating several dialog sessions from the same device is considered a unique user.

Changing the pricing plan
-------------------------

When you sign up for Alan Studio, the Free Tier plan is applied to your account. You get a limited number of interactions that you can spend to get to know the Alan Platform functionality.

To use the full version and remove the restrictions of the Free Tier, you must change the pricing plan. The pricing plan is applied to all projects of your account in Alan Studio. Limitations of the plan also apply to all projects of the account.

.. warning::

   To be able to change the pricing plan, you must have the sufficient amount on your Alan Studio balance. To switch to the Enterprise plan, contact the Alan Sales Team.

To change the pricing plan:

1. In the top right corner of Alan Studio, click the main menu icon and select **Subscription**.

2. In the **Alan pricing plans** view, review the pricing plans and the functionality they offer, choose the one that works best for you and in the plan widget, click **Change plan**.

Adding free interactions
------------------------

Alan provides you with the ability to add free interactions to your account. You can use this option if you are evaluating the Alan AI Platform and want to get familiar with it. The number of free interactions is enough to get you started.

To get free interactions: 

1. In the Alan Studio signup form, select to sign up with GitHub.
