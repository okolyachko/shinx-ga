Projects dashboard
==================

The projects dashboard in Alan Studio provides at-a-glance information about all voice assistants created on your account. With the top performance metrics and easy-to-read charts presented in one place, you can get transparency across your projects and track conversational data in real time.

Analytics widgets
-----------------

The dashboard is displayed as you log in to Alan Studio. Each widget in the dashboard provides data for a separate voice assistant project. While viewing the conversational data, you can:

-  **Switch between environments**: click the **Dev**, **Test** or **Prod** tab in the widget. For more details about Alan environments, see :doc:`Versions and environments <versioning>`.
-  **Switch between views**: use the list in the left part of the chart to select the necessary view: 

   - *Interactions & Recognized*
   - *Session & Mic Time*
   - *Users & Sessions*
   - *User Cities*
	  
   You can also switch between the views with the carousel controls under the chart.
   
-  **Select the reporting period**: in the right part of the chart, select the necessary time span:

   - *1 Day*
   - *2 Days*
   - *1 Week*
   - *1 Month*
