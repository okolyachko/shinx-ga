Testing and debugging
=====================

Testing and debugging are crucial to building a production quality voice assistant. You need to make sure the conversation flow covers all usage scenarios, correct replies are given and the necessary tasks are completed when intents are matched. The Alan Platform offers several tools and methods to test and debug your voice assistant:

-  :doc:`Debugging Chat <debugging-chat>`: use the chat to the right of Alan Studio to check how separate voice commands or short conversational branches work.
-  :doc:`Test View <test-view>`: switch to the Test View in Alan Studio to create test cases covering all required dialog scenarios and run them repeatedly against new versions of voice scripts.
-  :doc:`Alan Studio logs <logs>`: use the logs pane at the bottom of Alan Studio to see system messages from the Alan Platform along with custom messages written with the ``console.log`` function.
-  :doc:`In-app testing <in-app-testing>`: connect to the voice project from your mobile device to test the voice assistant functionality in
   the app.
