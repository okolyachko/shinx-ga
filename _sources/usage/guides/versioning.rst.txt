Versions and environments
=========================

You can create different versions of voice scripts and publish these versions to different environments.

Script versions
---------------

If a voice script goes through many iterations, you can create different script versions. A script version is a copy of the script in some state. After you create a script version, you cannot modify it.

Versions are the best way to keep track of your changes. You can use them to see what changes you have made to the script and what specifically has been changed.

To create a script version: 

1. In Alan Studio, open the project in which you want to create a script version. 

2. At the top of the code editor, click **Save as New Version**. 

3. In the **Version name** field, specify the name for the created version. 

4. (Optional) Alan does not recommend running the latest script version in the Production environment. The latest version contains the recent changes that may be not stable. If you want to run the script version you are creating in the production environment, enable the **Run on Production** option.

5. Click **Save**.

You can work with script versions in the following way: 

- To edit the version name, click the versions list, hover over the script version and click the edit icon. Then rename the script version as required. 
- To delete a script version, click the versions list, hover over the script version and click the delete icon. 
- To roll back to a specific version of the script, in the versions list, select the necessary version and click **Save to Last Version** to the right. 
- To compare two script versions, at the top of the code editor, click **Compare** and select the script versions to compare.

.. note: 

    - If you have multiple scripts in the project, operations with script versions affect all project scripts. For
    example, if you delete a script version for one script, the same version will be deleted for other scripts, too. 
	- You cannot delete a script version running in the Production environment.


Environments
------------

Alan Studio offers three different environments to develop, test and run your script:

-  The Development environment allows you to work on building the script, fixing bugs and adding new features to the script
-  The Testing environment is useful to provide a fixed pre-release version of the script to your QA team
-  The Production environment allows you to roll out the finalized script version to production

You can run different script versions in different environments. For example, you may want to deploy some version to be tested in your testing sandbox. You can do it in the following way:

1. In Alan Studio, at the top of the code editor, select the environment in which you want to run a script version.
2. In the versions list to the right, select the script version.
3. At the top of the code editor, click **Integrations**.
4. In the **Alan SDK Key** field, check the last segment of the key value. It will refer to the environment you have selected.
5. In the **Embed Code Example** section, click **Copy** to copy the code for the Alan button.
6. Embed the copied code to the application in the necessary environment.
