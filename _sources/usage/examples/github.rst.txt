Example apps on GitHub
======================

Our team have developed example apps for different platforms. You can
find these apps on Alan GitHub.

These are pre-made apps already integrated with Alan. You can use them
as a starting point to:

-  Try an app with a voice interface
-  Learn how integration for a specific platform can be implemented
-  Check how voice commands work

You can try our examples for the following platforms:

-  `Web <#web>`__
-  `Flutter <#flutter>`__
-  `Ionic <#ionic>`__
-  `Android <#android>`__
-  `iOS <#ios>`__

To run Alan example apps:

1. Clone the repository for the necessary platform to your computer.
2. Open the app in the IDE and explore it.
3. Run the app.
4. In the app, tap the Alan button and say:

   -  ``What does this app do?``
   -  ``What can I do here?``

5. Then follow Alan's instructions on the further conversation flow.
