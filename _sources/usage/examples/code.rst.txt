Integration code examples
=========================

To integrate a client app with Alan, you typically need to install the Alan button package, add the package dependency and a block of code for the Alan button to your app. You can find a detailed description of the integration procedure for every supported platform in the **Alan Client SDKs** section of this documentation.

If you need to get a brief integration overview with code examples, you can also check the **Integrations** section of Alan Studio.

1. In Alan Studio, at the top of the code editor, click **Integrations**.
2. At the top of the view, select the platform: **Web**, **iOS** or **Android**.
3. In the **Embed Code Example** section, click the tab for the framework or language you need.

   -  The left pane of the **Embed Code Example** section lists the main integration steps.
   -  The right pane contains code examples for these steps.
