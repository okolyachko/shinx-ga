Voice script examples
=====================

Alan Studio comes with a set of predefined voice scripts. You can add these scripts to your project at any time and use them as examples of conversation flows that you can create with Alan.

To add a predefined script, in the left pane of your Alan Studio project, click **Add script** and select the scripts you want to add.

.. note:: 

   Some of examples like Jeopardy game have their data distributed between several scripts. To see how they work, you need to add the whole set of scripts to the project.

Beside viewing the code of predefined scripts in Alan Studio and testing them in the Debugging Chat, you can check how these scripts work when run in a real app. To do this, you need to install Alan Playground for `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alan-playground/id1474478921?l=en>`__ or `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.alan.playground&hl=en_US>`__ and select the necessary example app in it.
