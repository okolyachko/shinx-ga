Alan handlers
=============

To build a voice user experience with Alan, you can use the following handlers on the client side:

-  `onCommand handler <command-handler.html>`__: handles commands sent from the voice scripts to the app. Use this handler to perform tasks or actions on voice commands in the client app: navigate between the app screens, highlight a UI element on the screen and so on.

-  `onButtonState handler <state-handler.html>`__: handles the Alan button state change events.

-  `onEvent handler <event-handler.html>`__: handles events received from Alan when the userâ€™s input is being recognized.
